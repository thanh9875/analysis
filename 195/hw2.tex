1. Consider the morphism $f: x \to y$. Show that if there exists a pair of morphisms $g, h: y \to x$ so that $fg = 1_x$ and $hf = 1_y$, then $g = h$ and $f$ is an isomorphism. 

Let $y_0 \in y$. 

Note that:
$(hf)g(y_0) = h(fg)(y_0)$

$\Leftrightarrow g(hf(y_0)) = (fg)(h(y_0))$

$\Leftrightarrow g(y_0) = h(y_0)$

$\Leftrightarrow g = h$

Since $g = h$, the initial conditions become $fg = 1_x$ and $gf = 1_y$, so $f$ is an isomorphism. $\square$

2. For any category $\mathcal{C}$ and any object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, show that there is a category $\mathcal{C}/c$ whose objects are morphisms with codomain $c$ and morphism from $f: x \to c$ to $g: y \to c$ is a map $h: x \to y$ so that $f = gh$.

Let $f, g, h$ be objects in $c / \mathcal{C}$ and $f: x \to c, ~ g: y \to c, ~ h:z \to c$. 

Let $k, l$ be morphisms in $c / \mathcal{C}$ and $k: x \to y, ~ l:y \to z$.

Since the set of morphisms in $c / \mathcal{C}$ is a subset of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$, it is associative.

To compose $k$ and $l$, by substituting $g = lh$ into $kg = f$, it becomes $k(lh) = f$. By associativity, it follows that $(kl)h = f$, so $kl$ is a morphisms in $\mathcal{C} / c$, and $kl: x \to z$.

For any object $f: x \to c$, the identity morphism of $f$ is the morphism $1_f: x \to x$. Also, in $\mathcal{C}$, the identity morphism of object $x$ is the morphism $1_x: x \to x$. So $1_f = 1_x$. 

So for any morphism $k: f \to g; x \mapsto y$, the composition morphism $1_fk = 1_xk = k$. Similarly, the composition morphism $k1_g = k1_y = k$.

So $\mathcal{C} / c$ forms a category. $\square$
