Suppose that $f_n$ converges to $f$ pointwise on some $D\subseteq \mathbb{R}$.  For each of the following statements, find a counter example disproving the claim.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If each $f_n$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ is uniformly continuous.
\item If each $f_n$ is bounded, then $f$ is bounded.
\item If each $f_n$ has a finite number of discontinuities, then $f$ has a finite number of discontinuities.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define $f_n(x) = x^n$ and $D = [0,1]$. For all $n$, $f_n(x)$ is continuous over the closed interval $[0,1]$, so $f_n(x)$ is uniformly continuous.

    Note that $f_n(x)$ converges pointwise to \[f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & x = 1 \\ 0 & \textit{else}\end{cases}\]which is not continuous. 

    \item Define \[f_n(x) = \begin{cases} n & x > n \\ x & -n \le x \le n \\ -n & x < -n \end{cases}\]

    Define $f(x) = x$. Note that $f_n$ converges to $f$ pointwise by choosing $N \geq |x_0|$. Finally, for each $n$, $f_n$ is bounded by $n$, and $f$ is unbounded.

    \item Define \[f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & x=n \\ 0 &\textit{else} \end{cases} \]

    Define $f(x) = 0$. Note that, for each $n$, $f_n(x)$ has exactly one discontinuities, and $f_n(x)$ converges to $f(x)$ pointwise by choosing $N \geq x_0$. Finally, $f(x)$ does not have any discontinuities.

\end{enumerate}
